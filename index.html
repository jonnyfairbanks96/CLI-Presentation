# The Basics
What is the command line?
- A user interface that is navigated by typing commands at prompts, instead of using the GUI.
This can be the BASH Shell, ZSH Shell or the Command Prompt in windows (I won't be talking about the command prompt in windows)

- Some of the basic commands we use all the time are:**`ls pwd cd cp mv rm mkdir`** and the list goes on. Heres a [cheat sheet](https://learncodethehardway.org/unix/bash_cheat_sheet.pdf).

File navigation in the shell becomes very easy with practice.
- **`cd <directory name>`** to change you directory
- **`ls`** to list the storage of your current directory
- **`pwd`** to print your current working directory

Each of these commands are used a lot in your day to day work.

# Advanced/Lesser known

Most command line tools are less known. (Here are some I just learned)

- **`man`** this is the manual for each commmad. Lets run **`man ls`**

This is pretty cool because now we can actually understand what each command actually does.
- What about **`man chmod`**? What is `chmod`?

This is the command to change file modes or Access Control Lists.
- For example if we look into the manual **`chmod +x file`** allows the execute/search bits.
- **`chmod -x file`** takes away those permissions
- - -
Some others I didn't know about but I think could have the potential to be useful.

**`file filename, ps, top, lsof -i tcp:port`**

# Why is the CLI useful?

Besides navigating files and moving them around what else can be done?

A quick search in you files using grep. grep is useful in many ways but particularly file searching.

**`grep -r hello *`** This will search all files and dirs recursively for the text 'hello' (case sensitive)

grep can also use regex to find text in files. **`grep -r '[Hh]ello' *`**

- - -
*Cool thing:*

The shell also uses * for any 'wild card' scenarios.

Say you want to delete any file with `.rb` at the end of it.

Just run **`rm *.rb`** (this can be dangerous but useful if used right)

# Scripting

Shell is very nice for writing your own [scripts](https://devhints.io/bash) if you don't want to re-run commands over and over again.

Bash is it's own language...
- We can do loops, functions, conditional logic, and much more.

A simple hello loop.

`for i in {1..5}; do`

`echo 'Hello from index' $i`

`done`

Say you want to use grep but hate typing you can make a function.

`search() {`
`grep -r $1 $2`
`}`

# CLI Apps

CLI Apps are everywhere.

npm, yarn, homebrew, git, etc.

However, not all have to be these, you can download and find as many of these as you'd like.

A few I have found and like are:
- The Silver Searcher [AG](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher)
- Fuzzy Finder [FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
- Visual for ls [Tree](http://brewformulas.org/Tree)
- Open your current git branch in your browswer [git open](https://github.com/paulirish/git-open)

All of thes I have found to be useful and use each day.

# Lets build your own CLI app.

`gem install OptionParser`

`touch app.rb`

`chmod +x app.rb`

In your app.rb add:

`#!/usr/bin/env ruby`

`require 'optparse'`
